I am starting a project using Riot Game's TFT API. I will use my TFT match history for Set 14 so far to create a database and make some visualizations based on my data. I plan on using python to make a script for me to manually pull my most recent game data. I will then clean the data and use sql to create a database to store the data. I plan on using both tools like matplotlib to create visualizations as well as tableau based on the excel sheets I make as well. The final thing I want to do is implement an AI such as gemini to see if I can incorporate it to also provide analysis on my playstyle and comp and etc.
