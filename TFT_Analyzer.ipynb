    "The data from Riot is accessed through riotwatcher. Since I am doing TFT specifically, I need the TFT Watcher. I imported ApiError as well so I can create some blocks later on that look for if I get an error code and figure why and what to do next. The data from the api is returned as a json file, that I will go through. I imported time so that I can make a timer between API calls due to the limits placed by Riot. I also need to load my api keys from an environment file, so that I don't make my API keys public :)"
